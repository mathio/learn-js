# learn-js

So you want to be a front-end web developer?

##  HTML

* Displays the content of the website (text, images)
* Start with [HTML basics (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics)
* You can play with HTML right in your browser on [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/)


## CSS

* Defines what the content looks like (colors, sizes, alignments, spacing, etc)
* Read [Getting started with CSS (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/Getting_started)
* You can play with CSS right in your browser on [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/)


## JavaScript

* Makes content interactive
* Learn from [The Modern JavaScript Tutorial](https://javascript.info/)
  * The bare minimum is [JavaScript Fundamentals section](https://javascript.info/first-steps)
  * I suggest to go through the whole tutorial
* [IDE / editor](https://javascript.info/code-editors)
  * For a quick start you can try online editor [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) (it is surprisingly good)
  * My personal favorite is [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) (not free)
  * Other very popular (and free) choice is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)


## Node.js

* JavaScript can be also run server-side
* It can run a server to serve your website, work with files, connect to databases and much more
* You need to [download and install it in your machine](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* Read [the tutorial](https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/) to get started
* [Official docs](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v14.x/docs/api/) are a great reference if you need to find something


## Yarn

* Package manager to install libraries or software (alternative to `npm` which comes with Node.js)
* You need to [install it on your machine](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/)
* Packages are usually downloaded from [node package manager registry](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* Learn [the yarn workflow](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/yarn-workflow)
* [Command line docs](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/) provide a great reference
* You will be able to install existing package to make your life easier
  * [`yarn add lodash`](https://lodash.com/) to your project to get access to various utility functions to work with arrays, objects, functions, etc.
  * or you can [`yarn add pg`](https://node-postgres.com/) to connect to postgres database


## React

* A library for building user interfaces in JavaScript
* Start with [official tutorial: Intro to React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)
* [Official docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) are great source too


## Next.js

* Framework built on top of React to make things easier
* Start with [official tutorial to learn how to create a Next.js app](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app)
* [Official docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) to better understand the framework


## Git

* Tool for sharing the code with other developers
* Find the [must-have basics in Git Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/)
* Hand-on with git in [interactive tutorial: Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)
* [Graphic apps](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis)
  * It is necessary to understand how git works (you should learn basics by using the terminal)
  * You can make your everyday life easier by using graphic app
  * My favorite is [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/). (Note: there is a [this serious bug](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/SRCTREE-7184) related to `husky` - [a solution is here](https://github.com/typicode/husky/issues/639#issuecomment-573281096)).
* It is not necessary to know all the commands (official docs https://git-scm.com/doc), no one knows them all
* Remote repositories for your projects: [GitHub.com](https://github.com/)
  * for sharing code with others
  * also for cloud backup
  * there other alternatives (eg [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/)) but Github is the most popular especially for open-source projects


# Learn more

If you are have an issue you are most likely not first - search [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) to find answers to your problems.

If you are using a library, read its docs first! Its usually [on project website](https://lodash.com/docs/) or in [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Typeform/embed).

> Remember, a few hours of trial and error can save you several minutes of looking at the README.

I would try to avoid [w3schools.com](http://w3schools.com/), [MDN (Mozilla Developer Network)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference) provides much more accurate references, tutorials and examples.
